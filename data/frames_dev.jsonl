{"text": "Lois Lenski's _The Little Fire Engine_ was first published in the 1940s. The pictures look a little bit dated and corny. Don't let that fool you. This is the best firefighter picture book; it's the standard by which all others have since been measured.In the story, Fireman Small races with the other firefighters to the scene of a fire, where they save a girl and her cat, locate the blaze, and extinguish it. They return to the firehouse. The story is so incredibly simple, but the author has laid everything out so that a child can learn so much from this book. Questions are answered, and children who know a lot about firefighters will have their curiosity piqued by everything in this book, from the \"nang, nang, nang, nang goes the bell\" to Fireman Small chopping a hole in the roof.My son and I have looked through lots of firefighting picture books, and I think _The Little Fire Engine_ is simply the best I've seen.ken32", "cats": {"conflict": 0.0, "economic": 0.0, "human_interest": 1.0, "policy_regulation": 0.0, "public_safety": 1.0, "environment": 0.0, "health": 0.0, "technology": 0.0}}

As Apple seem to be too stuck in dogma to make a decent 3-button that looks as good as an iMac, I bought a new Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer. The next day it went back - the wheel is dismal - and I tried every other mouse in the store. Finally, I plumped for the MX-500. And am I glad. This is a superb mouse; the ergonomics are perfect, the wheel is excellent, weight just so, additional keys actually useful and the software exactly enough for the job. It's a delight to use.
