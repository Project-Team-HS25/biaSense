Indeed, you will find some nice period pieces by Midler, usually with Johnny Mercer's name on the composition, such as \"Come Rain or Come Shine.\" But I have to admit to a slight sense of disappointment that the producers of this film seemed to go out of their way not to do anything too close to the songs that made the Divine Miss M famous in the first place. Ironically, the best track on the album is her wonderful cover of the Beatle's \"In My Life,\" which deservedly made its way onto Midler's greatest hits collection. This is a solid Midler album, the sort that comes in at 4.5 and then you round up or down according to your tastes.", "cats": {"pos": 1.0, "neg": 0.0, "neu": 0.0}}

{"text": "Great Jones Street is a wonderfully claire voyant novel that works sharply with themes that are of immense importance in the modern world. It is about pop arts, consumerism, the American junk culture and all the things that you can expect from DeLillo with the added element of dealing with problems with celebrity. Even when Bucky Wunderlick looks to escape from \"his\" life to be alone, his isolation becomes more valuable to others than it was meant to be to himself. This book deftly explores how the modern culture is dangerously obsessed with the lives of the few. Above all else, this is a more tightly structured novel than the later, greater works of DeLillo. Its opening pages lead right to the crux of the narrative and handles changes in time and place much smoother than Mao II and Underworld despite its hazy atmosphere.", "cats": {"pos": 1.0, "neg": 0.0, "neu": 0.0}}

Despite the words \"instant read\" on the package it took 25-30 seconds for the temp to climb to 180 degrees....water boils at 212 degrees. I put my Thermapen into the boiling water and within 4 seconds the temperature registered 212 degrees. I left the Taylor in the boiling water for 2 minutes and the temperature never rose above 185 degrees.Stay away from this item if you need accuracy or speed.

To me this book seemed to follow the new need felt by many people to apply math to some sort of situation, which is all fine and dandy but you need to learn how to do something before you can apply it, especially in problems such as the ones in this book.
