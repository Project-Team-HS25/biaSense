A lot of it is based on cruel slams about women past their prime, snide remarks about country folks. Don't know if it was meant to be cruel, but it comes off as mean-spirited, and does not seem to be coming strictly through the voice of the main character. I realize that Vernon is not meant to be Pollyanna or anything, but this is unrelentingly hard on everybody and everything.I could not maintain my interest in the plot. Sorry.

As a leader in the Neo-Primative smithing community, he ignores all that and starts you off with a fire in a hole in the ground powered by a hairdryer and some iron pipe, a flat surface to hammer on, a hammer, pliers or tongs, a file and some sand paper. Those and some metal to work with and you're ready to get started. His technique is excellent, and his philosophy if simple.I highly recommend this video to the beginning and experienced smith alike.

That was a little overdone. My biggest critisism though is that the characters seemed entirely too selfish. Joanna and Richard both spent a lot of time together and yet they didn't really have a romance. They mostly talked about work and spent all their time working.

There he meets Carole Lombard, the local librarian. They fall in love - at least she does, and they marry; Gable acts like it's a big joke. Of course, he gradually falls in love with her and even decides to turn himself in to the law. He's sentenced to three months in the slammer (he tells her he's going away to South America on business), and when he gets out, our happy couple is reconciled. The script is a good one, and the interplay between Gable and Lombard is lively and romantic. They really make a good pair, and it's a shame it was their only picture together, though they would marry in 1939.

{"text": "It took shear determination to finish this book. The plot was thin, unimaginative; just a very poorly written book to put it as kindly as possible.As an avid reader, I never begin a book without finishing it, but each time I picked this book up to read, I did so with a sense of dread. The story line never picked up, and the ending was extremely predictable.There is absolutely no suspense in this book. Just a lot of boredom. The only scary thing about this book, is the fact that I paid full price.For a great suspense/mystery, I would highly recommend \"Black For Remembrance\", by Carlene Thompson.", "cats": {"conflict": 0.0, "economic": 1.0, "human_interest": 1.0, "policy_regulation": 0.0, "public_safety": 0.0, "environment": 0.0, "health": 0.0, "technology": 0.0}}
