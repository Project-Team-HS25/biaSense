She blames the poor for most of their problems instead of the companies who pay wages that aren't livable. Why didn't she write a book about companies that feel it's ok to pay someone $5.00 and hour and expect them to survive in life. How can we as humans think this is acceptable behavior.

I loved the title and was eager to explore its contents. After several weeks, I was only able to make it halfway through the book. Boredom stopped me in my tracks. Not one of Yancey's best efforts. I'm not trying to be mean, rather, just want to give the purchaser a true observation. Don't get me wrong, two of Yancey's books are SPECTACULAR. Those would be \"The Jesus I Never Knew\" (Which I consider to be the best book ever written) and \"Disappointment with God\" (Which also was spectacular). If you want a good book, read one of these two works of Yancey's. As for \"Reaching the Invisible God,\" I wouldn't buy it.", "cats": {"pos": 0.0, "neg": 1.0, "neu": 0.0}}

There he meets Carole Lombard, the local librarian. They fall in love - at least she does, and they marry; Gable acts like it's a big joke. Of course, he gradually falls in love with her and even decides to turn himself in to the law. He's sentenced to three months in the slammer (he tells her he's going away to South America on business), and when he gets out, our happy couple is reconciled. The script is a good one, and the interplay between Gable and Lombard is lively and romantic. They really make a good pair, and it's a shame it was their only picture together, though they would marry in 1939. Worth a watch.", "cats": {"pos": 1.0, "neg": 0.0, "neu": 0.0}}

Unlike so many other books on environmental issues that are either dry or grim, this one is lively, witty, colorful, and lyrical. Above all, it is inspiring. People who care about the quality of life on earth get caught up playing defense, so it is refreshing to hear about those who have bold and proactive ideas who are going forward. I like it when an author makes me see the world differently and this book did that. Ward's first book, \"Canaries on the Rim,\" is a gem - a classic - that never got the attention it deserves. I hope this one is widely read.", "cats": {"pos": 1.0, "neg": 0.0, "neu": 0.0}}

The books document the first 150 years after manned landing on Mars and detail its colonization and terraformation, and wars between settlers on Mars and Earth. I found both books to be pretty boring. The characters are actually quite well-developed---four-dimensional---but not one is very likable. The descriptions of the technologies that allow the settlers to colonize Mars, terraform it, and prolong their lives are fascinating and seem well-studied. However, many interesting plots are introduced and then allowed to fade away, including the murder that opens the first book and the mystical powers of the Mars-born Nirgal that open the second book. There are long, drawn-out passages describing the Martian landscape, its history, and its natural versus its man-influenced evolution. If I read Blue Mars, it will only be to say I read all three.", "cats": {"pos": 0.0, "neg": 1.0, "neu": 0.0}}

As for the writing style, the sentences ar too short, which makes the rythm artificial and strained.

We rarely get rain but, when we do, it's usually a thunderstorm with high winds and a downpour for about 5 - 10 minutes. The box held up well for those types but did not do as well for a huge storm that lasted over an hour. Not typical for us but the box did not keep out the water so now we know. That is the only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5. I could not find any outdoor box that could keep out the rain 100%. It did, however, keep out bugs and scorpions which is almost worth an extra star! I highly recommend the Suncast Deck Box!", "cats": {"pos": 1.0, "neg": 0.0, "neu": 0.0}}

I loved how nearly every possible sexual temptation had a chapter of its own, and was pretty relieved when only one or two of the chapters really applied to me.The big negative of this book was the silly definitions at the bottom of the pages. I'm 21 years old, just one year older than the suggested range of 20-14, and I knew every single definition, from compartmentalization to clitoris. I suppose these must be very helpful for the younger readers though, and offer some honest definitions of a bunch of body parts.Anyway, I still really enjoyed the book, and I would recommend it to anyone going through any kind of battle with purity.

The \"enemy\" is not just the Pat Buchanans, David Dukes and J. Edgar Hoovers. The enemy includes brainwashed, confused, educated idiots who are \"African Americans\" by nothing more than ancestral procreation.What is the 21st century warning of an MLK event which happened in 1958?

I felt as though I might go back JUST to see if it ever got any better but then I asked someone to tell me about the ending and from what I heard it got even WORSE towards the end so thankfully I never have to turn it on again.

With open access now in effect on European railroads there is plenty of colorful action to report. Each edition has four sections: News, Main Article, Vehicles and History. It is lavishly illustrated with high quality color photographs, and some black and white ones in the history section. These photographs alone justify the cover price. It has an unusual format for a magazine, as it is printed in a near Octavo book size. This allows it to be kept on a bookshelf without a binder. It also fits discretely into ones briefcase! Each edition has 114 pages and it is not overwhelmed with advertisements. Indeed, most advertisements are for other offerings from the magazine's publisher. It is, in this reviewer's opinion, an essential monthly read for every aficionado of the mainland European railway scene.", "cats": {"pos": 1.0, "neg": 0.0, "neu": 0.0}}

It takes a bit longer than I thought to copy cd's to my computer in order to then copy them on to the cd player, but that's been the only hiccup.

I try to turn my head on the arrogant superstar persona Ani has decided to display, but there's not much else on this video. Ani Difranco is still the most dynamic singer songwriter in the industry today, but this video will not give you a good impression of her act. Save your money for when she comes to your town.

When he kind of lounges on the blown up part, his legs hang over the other side. Also, the material is kind of flimsy. I was afraid it would rip if I put it in the grass and there was a hidden stick or something, so I just kept it on the porch. It also comes with a patch, so I wasn't very convinced about it's durability. Other than those things, we love it!

By chapter three she talks about visualizing writing a best seller and gives a long pitch about how we should encourage friends to buy her book (and not to lend ours). What really trips me up though are the very cheesy, obviously contrived dialogues she has with everyone, particularly Bob Monroe himself in spirit. There are a lot of well-worn, but mortal sounding new age truisms that lack any fresh persepective. Bottom line is she's a sub-par writer, the story is suspect and lacks credibility, and compared to Robert Monroe's stuff its just plain boring.", "cats": {"pos": 0.0, "neg": 1.0, "neu": 0.0}}

Both deal with women in Vermont who practice non-traditional medicine and make mistakes that get them in hot water. The reasons that \"Similars\" is better is that 1) It has more humor. 2) It has a touching love story. 3) It depicts the love between a father and his young child poignantly. However, the case of the misguided homeopath is somewhat contrived and unrealistic. Nor do I believe that Fowler would have played fast and loose with the law the way he did. Bohjalian seems to be hung up on moral ambiguities in life. I have no problem with that per se, but he should stick a little closer to reality. However, in its favor, \"The Law of Similars\" is an engrossing and a fast read, with snappy dialogue and sharply delineated characters.

Only when she could finally get up and crawl did she tire of the mat.My only criticism is of the \"musical\" toy that dangles. It does have a switch on/off which is great. However, the volume of the music is LOUD! Many a dark night I tried to tiptoe past it and had a heart attack when I accidentally tapped the toy & the music blasted.
