She blames the poor for most of their problems instead of the companies who pay wages that aren't livable. Why didn't she write a book about companies that feel it's ok to pay someone $5.00 and hour and expect them to survive in life. How can we as humans think this is acceptable behavior.

I loved the title and was eager to explore its contents. After several weeks, I was only able to make it halfway through the book. Boredom stopped me in my tracks. Not one of Yancey's best efforts. I'm not trying to be mean, rather, just want to give the purchaser a true observation. Don't get me wrong, two of Yancey's books are SPECTACULAR. Those would be \"The Jesus I Never Knew\" (Which I consider to be the best book ever written) and \"Disappointment with God\" (Which also was spectacular). If you want a good book, read one of these two works of Yancey's. As for \"Reaching the Invisible God,\" I wouldn't buy it.", "cats": {"pos": 0.0, "neg": 1.0, "neu": 0.0}}

There he meets Carole Lombard, the local librarian. They fall in love - at least she does, and they marry; Gable acts like it's a big joke. Of course, he gradually falls in love with her and even decides to turn himself in to the law. He's sentenced to three months in the slammer (he tells her he's going away to South America on business), and when he gets out, our happy couple is reconciled. The script is a good one, and the interplay between Gable and Lombard is lively and romantic. They really make a good pair, and it's a shame it was their only picture together, though they would marry in 1939. Worth a watch.", "cats": {"pos": 1.0, "neg": 0.0, "neu": 0.0}}

People who care about the quality of life on earth get caught up playing defense, so it is refreshing to hear about those who have bold and proactive ideas who are going forward. I like it when an author makes me see the world differently and this book did that. Ward's first book, \"Canaries on the Rim,\" is a gem - a classic - that never got the attention it deserves. I hope this one is widely read.", "cats": {"pos": 1.0, "neg": 0.0, "neu": 0.0}}

The books document the first 150 years after manned landing on Mars and detail its colonization and terraformation, and wars between settlers on Mars and Earth. I found both books to be pretty boring. The characters are actually quite well-developed---four-dimensional---but not one is very likable. The descriptions of the technologies that allow the settlers to colonize Mars, terraform it, and prolong their lives are fascinating and seem well-studied. However, many interesting plots are introduced and then allowed to fade away, including the murder that opens the first book and the mystical powers of the Mars-born Nirgal that open the second book. There are long, drawn-out passages describing the Martian landscape, its history, and its natural versus its man-influenced evolution.

As for the writing style, the sentences ar too short, which makes the rythm artificial and strained.

We rarely get rain but, when we do, it's usually a thunderstorm with high winds and a downpour for about 5 - 10 minutes. The box held up well for those types but did not do as well for a huge storm that lasted over an hour. Not typical for us but the box did not keep out the water so now we know. That is the only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5. I could not find any outdoor box that could keep out the rain 100%. It did, however, keep out bugs and scorpions which is almost worth an extra star! I highly recommend the Suncast Deck Box!", "cats": {"pos": 1.0, "neg": 0.0, "neu": 0.0}}

I loved how nearly every possible sexual temptation had a chapter of its own, and was pretty relieved when only one or two of the chapters really applied to me.The big negative of this book was the silly definitions at the bottom of the pages. I'm 21 years old, just one year older than the suggested range of 20-14, and I knew every single definition, from compartmentalization to clitoris. I suppose these must be very helpful for the younger readers though, and offer some honest definitions of a bunch of body parts.Anyway, I still really enjoyed the book, and I would recommend it to anyone going through any kind of battle with purity.

The enemy includes brainwashed, confused, educated idiots who are \"African Americans\" by nothing more than ancestral procreation.What is the 21st century warning of an MLK event which happened in 1958?

I felt as though I might go back JUST to see if it ever got any better but then I asked someone to tell me about the ending and from what I heard it got even WORSE towards the end so thankfully I never have to turn it on again.

With open access now in effect on European railroads there is plenty of colorful action to report. Each edition has four sections: News, Main Article, Vehicles and History. It is lavishly illustrated with high quality color photographs, and some black and white ones in the history section. These photographs alone justify the cover price. It has an unusual format for a magazine, as it is printed in a near Octavo book size. This allows it to be kept on a bookshelf without a binder. It also fits discretely into ones briefcase! Each edition has 114 pages and it is not overwhelmed with advertisements. Indeed, most advertisements are for other offerings from the magazine's publisher. It is, in this reviewer's opinion, an essential monthly read for every aficionado of the mainland European railway scene.", "cats": {"pos": 1.0, "neg": 0.0, "neu": 0.0}}

It takes a bit longer than I thought to copy cd's to my computer in order to then copy them on to the cd player, but that's been the only hiccup.

I try to turn my head on the arrogant superstar persona Ani has decided to display, but there's not much else on this video. Ani Difranco is still the most dynamic singer songwriter in the industry today, but this video will not give you a good impression of her act. Save your money for when she comes to your town.

When he kind of lounges on the blown up part, his legs hang over the other side. Also, the material is kind of flimsy. I was afraid it would rip if I put it in the grass and there was a hidden stick or something, so I just kept it on the porch. It also comes with a patch, so I wasn't very convinced about it's durability. Other than those things, we love it!

By chapter three she talks about visualizing writing a best seller and gives a long pitch about how we should encourage friends to buy her book (and not to lend ours). What really trips me up though are the very cheesy, obviously contrived dialogues she has with everyone, particularly Bob Monroe himself in spirit. There are a lot of well-worn, but mortal sounding new age truisms that lack any fresh persepective. Bottom line is she's a sub-par writer, the story is suspect and lacks credibility, and compared to Robert Monroe's stuff its just plain boring.", "cats": {"pos": 0.0, "neg": 1.0, "neu": 0.0}}

Both deal with women in Vermont who practice non-traditional medicine and make mistakes that get them in hot water. The reasons that \"Similars\" is better is that 1) It has more humor. 2) It has a touching love story. 3) It depicts the love between a father and his young child poignantly. However, the case of the misguided homeopath is somewhat contrived and unrealistic. Nor do I believe that Fowler would have played fast and loose with the law the way he did. Bohjalian seems to be hung up on moral ambiguities in life. I have no problem with that per se, but he should stick a little closer to reality. However, in its favor, \"The Law of Similars\" is an engrossing and a fast read, with snappy dialogue and sharply delineated characters.

Only when she could finally get up and crawl did she tire of the mat.My only criticism is of the \"musical\" toy that dangles. It does have a switch on/off which is great. However, the volume of the music is LOUD! Many a dark night I tried to tiptoe past it and had a heart attack when I accidentally tapped the toy & the music blasted.

I have gotten maybe 20 nice pics out of over a 1000........The problem is its SO low in pixels. We hear about 5MP cameras and up, this camera has less than 1MP!!!! I bought this before I knew anything about megapixels........You have to have 5 or more for the prints to be decent. All of my prints from this camera are bad! And they are only good for email. That's it. The camcorder capabilities are fair. My problem is that it doesn't work well on the computer, and it does NOT play immediately in all dvd players. You HAVE to buy the very expensive RAM discs for editing....Overall, I definitely would NOT buy again and I would not reccommend to a friend. I wish I had spent all that money on something else.....", "cats": {"pos": 0.0, "neg": 1.0, "neu": 0.0}}

Some available on Amazon are: Stella Maris, Daddy Long Legs, Little Annie Rooney, Tess of the Storm Country, and My Best Girl. Also Highly recommended is Eileen Whitfield's Biography, Pickford:the woman who made Hollywood. For the record, I have nothing against Julia Roberts, but I can't stand such unoriginality in a title.

In saying that, the book is not just about the making of the movie. That's only part of the story. This book gives you a brief history of the following: movies about racing; a small history of the Le Mans race itself; a history of the teams involved in the film - Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Lola, Matra, and Porsche; followed by a brief history of the Daytona and Sebring races (featuring Steve); and finally it all comes together in the making of the movie. The personal anecdotes of the drivers involved are quite interesting. For lovers of the movie, the race, and the man himself, this book won't let you down.

I felt dazed and down for days after seeing this film, due to its twisted psychology, and the ending (with the bells ringing in the sky) is one of the corniest ever - pure kitsch. On the other hand, Emily Watson's performance in the leading role is possibly the best I've ever seen on film (up there with Brando as Vito Corleone, Anthony Quinn as Zorba, and Meryl Streep in ... well, just about any of her roles).

Which means that you are understanding it intellectually, logically, but you don't really KNOW what he is talking about.It takes a while to understand what is going on, but you cannot force yourself to understand it.

Everyone I have ever given this product to loved it, except my kids when they were real young. I think the short lived rubbing alcohol smell that you get when you put the product on was the problem. But it goes away in about 5 seconds, and then you smell nothing. Why the manufacturer does not promote this product more is beyond me.", "cats": {"pos": 1.0, "neg": 0.0, "neu": 0.0}}

Here Ritchie fails, resorting to asinine gags such as the oft-mentioned \"Old Kuntz\" reitrement home...a dismal joke that is more appropriate for the one-dimensional gross-out comedies that have plagued the theaters recently. With Ritchie casting Madonna in his next film, one can only hope it doesn't resemble this failed exercise in adolescent misanthropy. I would applaud Mtv for banning this video, if it had not been done for the wrong reasons.

After looking at the sheets I found them to be rather confusing for me (I don't understand why there were so many steps to form a lower case d for example) and with one child with needs and knowing her personality I knew this was not going to work for her at all. This method would surely cause tears for her. Unfortunately, this is the preferred method in the district.Right now we are working with a wipe off book in manuscript style and though its not perfect she is not frustrated and enjoys practicing all the letters on her own.

{"text": "I bought this to go around the tree last month and was very excited. The train set up easily but I noticed that the whistle button on the transformer was stuck down. It would either continue blowing or wouldn't blow. I called amazon and they sent another one out immediately. This second one also had messed up transformer buttons. This time I called Lionel. They seemed to be familiar with the problem and sent me another transformer to exchange. This transformer eventually arrived but also had a messed up button. But it seemed to work better than the previous ones. I set up the train and then noticed that the engine wouldn't work as easily on the track as the very first one that I set up. So after several weeks, three, transformers, and two trains, I decided to just send it back and get a refund. By this time Christmas was already past.I thought that I might want to take this up as a hobby but not anymore. Oh well.I will say that Amazons service was excellent as usual.", "cats": {"pos": 0.0, "neg": 1.0, "neu": 0.0}}

The script is not interesting. \"Buccaneer's Girl\" with Yvonne De Carlo was the best of the lot, but still not worth the effort. Yvonne De Carlo is better in \"Song of Scheherazade\".

It was packaged very well.I feel much more comfortable with these detectors in our home. I can push the peak level button to see if any amount of CO has been detected in the last 24 hours. So far mine has always shown 0 ppm. However, I have a family member that also bought a few of these, upon my recommendation. Their detector showed 52 ppm the other day. So they vented the house and are looking for the source.I have more much peace of mind knowing that it will show me what level is detected.

Rather than just tips and tricks for homework hassles with your kid, this book teaches PARENTS how to better guide their children so - methodically in turn - children magically start accepting their responsibilities, which in the end prepares them for responsible adulthood. The more you hound, the more you \"hover,\" the more you check on them, the more you worry for them, the less they do themselves, which progressively makes them more dependent on you and less on themselves. This theory took me by surprise, as I wanted to be extremely involved with my child's work in school. But I had no idea I was actually hindering her growth and understanding of responsibility and accountability. The book also offers help for parents and children with consistent homework problems, attitudes and resistance. Excellent and easy-to-read.", "cats": {"pos": 1.0, "neg": 0.0, "neu": 0.0}}

{"text": "At one time Ms. Enoch was my favorite romance writer. I even bought all her old novels (on amazon, no less, AND they were NOT cheap, some going for $20) That is how much I really liked her style of writing. I don't know what has changed...I know we can all get into a funk here and there. Maybe it is because I have found some other great authors too, so it's just not Enoch anymore. Her last 2 novels, this book along with ENGLANDS GREATEST HERO just has not been up to snuff compared with her earlier works. I feel like she could be writing much better stories and creating much more interesting and complex characters than she has been doing lately. There use to be a lot of intensity and passion between the hero and heroine, therefore creating some good juicy dialogue,so that you are really savoring the book AND not being able to put it down.

Like a lot of Van's albums, this music gets in your head and grows with time. The voice-as-instrument sounds like blasts from a well-payed horn. And speaking of playing, one of the benefits of being a Van Morrison fan is the perfection he demands of his backing musicians. This excellent band has more of a Bob Wills \"roots\" country feel, with some killer fiddle. I usually play my CD's on random play in a 200 disk changer, but this one I play front to back frequently since I bought it.

APC refuses to pay for replacement garage door openers since in their determination, the surge protectors are functioning properly (I had to send the surge protectors at my expense for analysis at their labs).I will never contend that a surge protector can protect any device from a direct lightning strike, but the APC warranty contends that they will replace your equipment in the event this unfortunate event occurs.I now do not recommend APC equipment, since their warranty is worthless.", "cats": {"pos": 0.0, "neg": 1.0, "neu": 0.0}}

The unit is quiet, very powerful, and will easily handle ice cubes, Chinese herbs (often tough fibrous bark), or anything else I've tried. A glass jar is also appreciated. Proper cleaning requires unscrewing the base from the jar, which usually works OK. I find that I have to use the tightening tool that comes with it to both tighten and remove the base, otherwise it may leak. A few useful tips: I apply a little coconut or other vegetable oil to the threads before screwing the base back on - this makes it easier to subsequently remove it too, and provides a better seal during use. Secondly, I make sure not to cross-thread the base as this can be a disaster for leaks. To do this, I run my fingers around the black plastic screw seal to make sure that it feels uniformly flat, and not tilted to one side. Finally, I fill the jar with some water prior to use, just to verify it is properly sealed.", "cats": {"pos": 1.0, "neg": 0.0, "neu": 0.0}}

{"text": "While this is a much inferior product when compared to the original Petromalt, it does still work for the intended purpose. The trick is handling the runny, sticky, gooey mess the new product has become and making it palatable to the cat. Unfortunately, I've found no suitable substitute, most competitive products being a similar mess.First, refrigerate the Petromalt. This will allow you to handle it more easily and appears to appeal more to the cat, since it attenuates the stickiness which seems to confound their efforts to eat it. Take a small plate or saucer and get a layer of cold water in it, which helps prevent the product sticking to the plate. Squeeze out some Petromalt and use a utensil, like a knife, to cut a portion off at the nozzle, into the plate. Shove a few kibble treats into the Petromalt and serve immediately, before it warms and becomes gooey.I make no excuses for the manufacturer, but I've found this technique at least makes the product usable.", "cats": {"pos": 0.0, "neg": 1.0, "neu": 0.0}}

It would turn on, but wouldn't take any pictures. We tried regular batteries and alkaline batteries (the batteries are very hard to put in and take out), but nothing worked. After a whole day of trying to get the thing to work, we decided to just give him our old digital which still takes great pictures and has a rechargable battery that we can get out without a struggle. He loves it and takes surprisingly good pictures. I guess the moral of the story is \"make sure all toys work before christmas morning,\" but based on my own experience and other's comments, I think this product could be improved.", "cats": {"pos": 0.0, "neg": 1.0, "neu": 0.0}}

We acquired it in the early seventies, while we were planning to leave our life in NYC and travel in a camper with our family for an indeterminate length of time. It was one of about sixty audiotapes that we took with us on our odyssey. We rarely got radio reception while we lived on the road, so we listened to those sixty tapes repeatedly for two years. Exuma's sounds always carried us to even more exotic places than those through which we were passing. When we settled down, we continued listening to it. Somewhere along the line, the audiotape was lost. I was thrilled to find that it had been reissued as a CD.
